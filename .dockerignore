# List of files to ignore from docker's perspective.
# The more we can exclude the higher likelihood we can reuse cached layers.

# Be careful about excluding a lot (e.g. with **/*) and then including files:
# https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/30018
# As such, this dockerignore only explicitly excludes targeted items.
