Unresolved addresses found: [
Named address 'B' in package 'OtherDep'
Named address 'B' in package 'Root'
]
To fix this, add an entry for each unresolved address to the [addresses] section of tests/test_sources/compilation/one_dep/Move.toml: e.g.,
[addresses]
std = "0x1"
Alternatively, you can also define [dev-addresses] and call with the --dev flag
