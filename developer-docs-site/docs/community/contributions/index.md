# Aptos Community Highlights

This page shines a light on exemplary contributions to Aptos from our community members. These enhancements can be documentation, features, or both. These highlights complement both the standalone [Ecosystem Projects](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/ecosystem-projects) and [External Resources](../external-resources.md) from the community.

To add your own contribution here, first submit a new page to Aptos.dev or a product feature in the [`aptos-core`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core) repository. Then add a link to the new documentation or code from the table below.

The source materials for both code and docs live in GitHub. See [Contribute](../index.md) for ways to make updates.
