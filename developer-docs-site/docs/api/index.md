# Aptos API

This is an index to pages that allow you to explore the API of the Aptos node. There are many different versions of the Aptos node active at any given time, e.g. devnet, AITs, etc. Each of those might have a different spec, as we land improvements to the API over time. Here you can explore the API for a particular Aptos deployment.
