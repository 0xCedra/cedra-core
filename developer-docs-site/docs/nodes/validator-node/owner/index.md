### Detailed steps

:::caution Before you proceed
Proceed to the below steps only if you are selected to participate in the AIT-3.
:::

1. Confirm that you received the token from the Aptos team by checking the balance of your Petra wallet. Make sure you are connected to the AIT-3 network by click **Settings** â†’ **Network**.

2. Create another wallet address for the voter. See [the above Step 4: Create the wallet using Petra](#create-wallet) to create a wallet on Petra. This step is optional. You can use the owner wallet account as voter wallet as well. However, the best practice is to have a dedicate voting account so that you do not need to access your owner key frequently for governance operations.

3. <span id="stake-delegate"><b>Next you will stake and delegate.</b></span>

  :::tip Read the Staking document

  Make sure you read the [Staking](/concepts/staking) documentation before proceeding further.
  :::

  You will begin by initializing the staking pool and delegating to the operator and the voter.

    1. From the Chrome browser, go to the [**Staking section** of the Aptos Governance page for AIT-3](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/proposals/staking?network=ait3).
    2. Make sure the wallet is connected with your **owner** account.
    3. Provide the following inputs:
        1. Staking Amount: 100000000000000 (1 million Aptos coin with 8 decimals)
        2. Operator Address: The address of your operator account. This is the `operator_account_address` from the "operator.yaml" file, under `~/$WORKSPACE/$USERNAME` folder.
        3. Voter Address: The wallet address of your voter.
    4. Click **SUBMIT**. You will see a green snackbar indicating that the transaction is successful.

6. Next, as the owner, using Petra wallet, transfer 5000 coin each to your operator address and voter wallet address. Both the operator and the voter will use these funds to pay the gas fees while validating and voting.

7. DEFINE NEXT STEP.

  You can either enter the private key from an existing wallet, or create new wallet address depends on your need.

    --voter-address <voter-address> \
    --profile testnet-owner
  ```

  aptos account transfer \
    --account <operator-address> \
    --amount <amount> \
    --profile testnet-owner
