## Initializing staking pool

In AIT3 we will have UI support to allow owner managing the staking pool, see details [here](https://aptos.dev/nodes/ait/steps-in-ait3#initialize-staking-pool), if you've already done this through the UI, you can igore this step and jump into "Bootstrapping validator node". 

Once you have completed the below, you can go to [Connecting to Aptos Incentivized Testnet](/nodes/ait/connect-to-testnet) for detailed steps on how to get your node connected to the blockchain

## Initialize staking pool

### Detailed steps

:::caution Before you proceed
Proceed to the below steps only if you are selected to participate in the AIT-3.
:::

1. Confirm that you received the token from the Aptos team by checking the balance of your Petra wallet. Make sure you are connected to the AIT-3 network by click **Settings** â†’ **Network**.

2. Create another wallet address for the voter. See [the above Step 4: Create the wallet using Petra](#create-wallet) to create a wallet on Petra. This step is optional. You can use the owner wallet account as voter wallet as well. However, the best practice is to have a dedicate voting account so that you do not need to access your owner key frequently for governance operations.

3. <span id="stake-delegate"><b>Next you will stake and delegate.</b></span>

  :::tip Read the Staking document

  Make sure you read the [Staking](/concepts/staking) documentation before proceeding further. 
  :::

  You will begin by initializing the staking pool and delegating to the operator and the voter. 

    1. From the Chrome browser, go to the [**Staking section** of the Aptos Governance page for AIT-3](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/proposals/staking?network=ait3).
    2. Make sure the wallet is connected with your **owner** account.
    3. Provide the following inputs:
        1. Staking Amount: 100000000000000 (1 million Aptos coin with 8 decimals)
        2. Operator Address: The address of your operator account. This is the `operator_account_address` from the "operator.yaml" file, under `~/$WORKSPACE/$USERNAME` folder.
        3. Voter Address: The wallet address of your voter.
    4. Click **SUBMIT**. You will see a green snackbar indicating that the transaction is successful.

6. Next, as the owner, using Petra wallet, transfer 5000 coin each to your operator address and voter wallet address. Both the operator and the voter will use these funds to pay the gas fees while validating and voting.

7. Proceed to **Connect to AIT-3 and join the validator set**.


Alternatively, you can also use CLI to intialize staking pool:

- Initialize CLI with your wallet **private key**, you can get in from Settings -> Credentials

  ```
  aptos init --profile ait3-owner \
    --rest-url https://ait3.aptosdev.com
  ```

- Initialize staking pool using CLI

  ```
  aptos stake initialize-stake-owner \
    --initial-stake-amount 100000000000000 \
    --operator-address <operator-address> \
    --voter-address <voter-address> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Don't forget to transfer some coin to your operator account to pay gas, you can do that with Petra, or CLI

  ```
  aptos account create --account <operator-account> --profile ait3-owner
  
  aptos account transfer \
  --account <operator-account> \
  --amount 5000 \
  --profile ait3-owner
  ```
  
## Staking with CLI

We now have a UI to support some staking operation, but in any case if you need to do operations not supported in UI, you can use CLI for it.

- Initialize CLI with your wallet private key or create new wallet

  ```
  aptos init --profile ait3-owner \
    --rest-url http://ait3.aptosdev.com
  ```

  You can either enter the private key from an existing wallet, or create new wallet address depends on your need.

- Initialize staking pool using CLI

  ```
  aptos stake initialize-stake-owner \
    --initial-stake-amount 100000000000000 \
    --operator-address <operator-address> \
    --voter-address <voter-address> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Transfer coin between accounts

  ```
  aptos account transfer \
    --account <operator-address> \
    --amount <amount> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Switch operator

  ```
  aptos stake set-operator \
    --operator-address <new-operator-address> \ 
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Switch voter

  ```
  aptos stake set-delegated-voter \
    --voter-address <new-voter-address> \ 
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Add stake

  ```
  aptos stake add-stake \
    --amount <amount> \
    --profile ait3-owner \
    --max gas 5000 # you can play around with the max gas here
  ```

- Increase stake lockup

  ```
  aptos stake increase-lockup --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Unlock stake

  ```
  aptos stake unlock-stake \
    --amount <amount> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Withdraw stake

  ```
  aptos stake withdraw-stake \
    --amount <amount> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```
