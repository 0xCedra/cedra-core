# A lottery example using on-chain randomness (AIP-41)

We give:

1. An example of an **insecure** lottery app, susceptible to undergasing attacks, in [`sources/lottery_insecure.move`](sources/lottery_insecure.move)
2. An example of a **secure** lottery app in [`sources/lottery_secure.move`](sources/lottery_secure.move)

In addition, we have some reasonable tests in [`sources/lottery_test.move`](sources/lottery_test.move).
