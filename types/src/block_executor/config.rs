/// Configuration for BlockSTM: determines behavior of the workers that commit
/// a transactions and may perform a 'fallback' execution of the immediately
/// following transaction t in order to make sure the critical path of the block
/// execution does not contain validation failure and re-execution of t.
///
/// The default setting is provided by the implementation whereby certain few
/// workers are designated as committers: only these workers attempt to commit
/// transactions in rolling commit, and may perform the fallback. Since committing
/// as early as possible is desired, these workers otherwise perform only tasks
/// close to the committed prefix, to avoid potentially long dependency waiting.
///
/// In the 'All' setting, all workers act as committers and may perform fallback
/// executions, but they can also each perform any task (no 'close to the
/// committed prefix' restriction). This setting is used for testing with the
/// mock executor (that may pause some ongoing executions / workers) to ensure
/// that the commits (and fallback executions) always happen.
///
/// In the 'None' setting, all workers act as committers, and fallback is disabled.
/// Like 'All' there is no restriction on what tasks a worker can perform. This
/// setting is also intended for testing and debugging purposes.
