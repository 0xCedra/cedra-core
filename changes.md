# Summary of changes

* `storage_gas.move` is modified to include docgen-ready comments.
* `.gitignore` is modified to include `storage_gas.md`, a docgen file for `storage_gas.move` that supports internal linking against function signatures.
* `shorthands.sh` is added to make docgen scripting easier on developers: if building gas documentation is a hassle, the docgen file is less likely to be kept current against source.
